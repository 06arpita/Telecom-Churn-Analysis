Dataset Overview

This dataset captures detailed information about customer demographics, service subscriptions, billing details, and churn behavior from a telecom/service-based company. It provides a comprehensive view of how customers interact with the company’s services, the types of plans they subscribe to, the revenue they generate, and whether they continue or discontinue the service.

The dataset includes variables related to personal profile, tenure, service usage, value-added features, payment methods, and financial contributions. It is well-suited for analyzing customer retention, identifying churn drivers, performing revenue analysis, and building predictive models for churn forecasting.
